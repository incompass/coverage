#### Installation
I recommend using the phar archive for installation. Simply download the [latest release](https://github.com/incompass/coverage/releases/latest), move it to ```/usr/local/bin/coverage``` and do a ```chmod +x /usr/local/bin/coverage``` and you are all set to go. Run ```coverage --help``` for further usage instructions.
